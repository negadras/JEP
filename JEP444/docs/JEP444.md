# Guidelines for Using Virtual Threads in Java

Virtual threads in Java are lightweight threads that enable you to write scalable concurrent applications more easily.
To determine when virtual threads make sense for your application, follow these guidelines:

---

## 1. Assess the Nature of Your Workload

### **I/O-Bound vs. CPU-Bound**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **I/O-Bound Tasks**: Your application spends significant time waiting for I/O operations (e.g., network calls,
        database queries). While virtual threads are great for I/O-bound tasks, they still have some overhead.
        For very short-lived tasks, the creation and management of virtual threads might not always be beneficial.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **CPU-Bound Tasks**: Your application is computation-heavy and utilizes CPU cores fully. Virtual threads won't
         improve performance here.

---

## 2. Evaluate Concurrency Requirements

### **Level of Concurrency**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **High Concurrency Needs**: You need to handle thousands or millions of concurrent tasks or connections.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Low Concurrency Needs**: Traditional threads suffice for a small number of concurrent tasks.

---

## 3. Consider Your Programming Model Preference

### **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Prefer Simplicity**: You want to write code in a straightforward, sequential manner without complex
         asynchronous code.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Asynchronous Model Works**: You're effectively using non-blocking I/O and reactive programming patterns.

---

## 4. Analyze Resource Constraints

### **Thread Management**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Thread Limitations Exist**: You're hitting limits with thread pools or experiencing thread exhaustion.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **No Thread Constraints**: Thread resources are not a bottleneck in your application.

---

## 5. Check Compatibility with Existing Code

### **Legacy Code and Libraries**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Migrating Blocking Code**: You have existing blocking code that you'd like to scale better without extensive
         refactoring.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Optimized Asynchronous Code**: Your codebase is already optimized with non-blocking I/O and doesn't benefit
         from virtual threads.

---

## 6. Be Mindful of Synchronization and Locks

### **Thread Pinning Concerns**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Minimal Synchronization**: Your code avoids excessive use of `synchronized` blocks or methods.

  - **Use Modern Concurrency Utilities**: You prefer `java.util.concurrent` locks (e.g., `ReentrantLock`) over
         intrinsic locks.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Heavy Synchronization**: Frequent use of synchronized blocks that can pin virtual threads and hinder
         scalability.

---

## 7. Evaluate Native Code Usage

### **Interaction with Native Libraries**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Minimal Native Calls**: Your application doesn't heavily rely on blocking native code or JNI.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Blocking Native Operations**: Extensive use of native code that can pin threads and negate the benefits of
         virtual threads.

---

## 8. Consider Tooling and Monitoring Needs

### **Debugging and Profiling**

- **Use Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Tool Support Exists**: Your debugging and monitoring tools support virtual threads.

- **Avoid Virtual Threads When**:

  - **Tool Limitations**: Your tooling cannot handle the large number of virtual threads effectively.

---

## **Rule of Thumb**

- **Opt for Virtual Threads If**:

  - Your application is **I/O-bound**, requires **high concurrency**, and you prefer a **simple, synchronous
      programming style**.

- **Stick with Traditional Threads If**:

  - Your application is **CPU-bound**, uses **heavy synchronization**, or relies on **blocking native calls**.

## **Key Questions to Ask Yourself**

1. **Is my application predominantly waiting for I/O operations?**

2. **Do I need to manage a large number of concurrent tasks or connections?**

3. **Would my code benefit from a simpler, sequential programming model?**

4. **Am I encountering limitations with traditional thread pools?**

5. **Does my application avoid heavy synchronization and blocking native calls?**

6. **Are my development tools compatible with virtual threads?**
